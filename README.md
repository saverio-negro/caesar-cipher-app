## Caesar Cipher Story

<p>Caesar Cipher is the way of encoding text that was seen as early as during the time of Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>
"The Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC, is a substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted. 
To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift. 
Arab mathematician Al-Kindi broke the Caesar Cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies." <br>

## How Does Caesar Cipher App Work?

<p>
  Are you the kind of person that, more than others, likes to keep their secrets covered up? Well, why don't you try encrypting sensitive information with Caesar Ciphering? ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ§®
</p>

<p>
  The application is quite simple. You input your message to encrypt, and then each of the words in the message will be shifted by a certain shifting amount that you and the recipient agreed upon.
  The recipient can then decrypt your message by inserting both the encrypted message as well as the shifting amount. ðŸ¤“
